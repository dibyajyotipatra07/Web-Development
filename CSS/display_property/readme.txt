to chagne display property of inline and block element:
-display: inline; for inlinr element but the top margin and padding can not be applied
-display: inline-block; here we can apply marginand padding at any end

display: none; removes the element totally with that space
visibility: hidden; just hide the element with the text, here the occupir=ed space will still be there

-display: block; make it block element
-display: flex; mainly worked to center element with another attribute
(justify-content: center)
-display: grid;
