list: marker and value, the bullet points are marker and the rest are the values
we can change the style of the list marker by
list-style: ...... (if set to none: the marker vanishes)

if we set background color of the list the value part is only applied, if we want the marker also, so:
list-style-position: inside

we can add border to the list by border attribute

we can add any marker of our choice, it may be emoji, disc, circle or image:
lis-style-type:
list-style-image: url()
